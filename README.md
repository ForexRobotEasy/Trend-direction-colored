## Indicator Overview

The 'Trend direction colored' indicator is a custom indicator designed to display trend direction based on candle colors. Green-colored candles indicate an upward trend, red-colored candles indicate a downward trend, and non-colored candles indicate a continuation of the previous trend direction.

## Indicator Parameters

- `indicator_chart_window` - Displays the indicator in a separate chart window.
- `indicator_buffers 1` - Defines the number of indicator buffers used.
- `indicator_color1 LimeGreen` - Sets the color for the indicator line.

## Indicator Initialization

The `OnInit()` function is responsible for initializing the indicator. It sets the index style and buffer mapping for the indicator.

## Indicator Calculation

The `OnCalculate()` function calculates the indicator values for each bar. It determines the trend direction based on the comparison between the close and open prices of each bar. Green-colored candles are assigned a value of 0, red-colored candles are assigned a value of 1, and non-colored candles are assigned the previous trend direction value. The calculated values are stored in the `TrendBuffer` array.

## Product Description

The 'Trend direction colored' indicator is a powerful tool for identifying trend direction in the Forex market.
